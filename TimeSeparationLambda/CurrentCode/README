README for Stochastic Control simulations

Here is the workflow for this code.  Its a little awkward because generally I have something like this running in a particular file structure, and over several different dimensions of parameter space

Within the directory 'Trajectories_a95' run the code CPGenerator.py, this will generate a large number of control protocols which are generated from a stochastic path ensemble and it will write their trajectories to this directory

Now from the parent directory, run 'WorkCalculations_a95.py', this will simualte the dynamics of a system evolving with the protocols generated by 'CPGenerator.py' for the set of parameters defined in 'Parameters.py'

The PathParameters95.py file specifies the path of the Control parameter trajectories.
